# Pullwise Worker Agent Notes

## Problem Solving Discipline

When resolving failures or regressions, do not default to adding diagnostic
patches or surface-level workarounds first. Identify the root cause from the
current code and available evidence, then fix that root cause. Add diagnostics
only when they directly support root-cause isolation or make a verified fix
safer to operate.

## Worker Host Platform

Pullwise worker installs target Ubuntu 22.04 hosts. Worker runtime, doctor,
update, restart, uninstall, and cleanup changes may assume Linux/systemd
behavior available on Ubuntu 22.04, including `useradd`, `chown`, `chmod`,
`sudo`/`runuser`, logrotate, and systemd unit management. Do not add macOS or
Windows worker installer behavior.

## Worker Provider Isolation

Each worker instance owns its own Codex runtime state. Do not let a
worker use global Codex binaries, global auth, root auth, or another
worker instance's config.

- Provider commands must resolve to absolute paths inside the current worker
  `service_home`, for example:
  - `$service_home/.local/bin/codex`
  - `$service_home/.codex/bin/codex`
- Provider subprocesses must run with instance-scoped environment values:
  - `HOME=$service_home`
  - `USERPROFILE=$service_home`
  - `CODEX_HOME=$service_home/.codex`
  - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$service_home/.config`
  - `XDG_CACHE_HOME=$service_home/.cache`
  - `XDG_DATA_HOME=$service_home/.local/share`
  - `PATH` with this worker's `$service_home/.local/bin`,
    `$service_home/.codex/bin` before the base service path
- Do not inherit global provider credentials such as root `HOME`,
  root `CODEX_HOME`, or global API-key based readiness when checking or running
  provider work.
- `doctor`, provider readiness checks, provider review execution, and semantic
  fallback execution must all use the same instance-scoped provider environment.
- A fresh install followed by no manual action and then `doctor` must report the
  same provider readiness state as the installer reported. In particular,
  `doctor` must not become ready by seeing auth/config from root, a global CLI
  install, or another worker.

Multiple workers on the same server are supported only if each worker uses its
own `service_home` for Codex binaries, config, cache, and auth state.

## Codex Review Worker Architecture

`../worker-design.md` is the source of truth for worker review behavior. The
current worker is the `review-worker-protocol/v1` Codex full-repository review
worker; do not reintroduce graph-generation review pipelines, `codex exec` review flows,
local job queues, or worker-side prefetch compatibility.

Hard invariants:

- One worker instance may process at most one active job at a time.
- The worker must not maintain `pending_jobs`, `prefetched_jobs`, `next_job`, or
  any local job queue.
- The worker may call lease only when `active_job == null`, state is `idle`, and
  the local queue depth is zero.
- A busy, cancelling, or finishing worker must heartbeat with zero available job
  slots and must not claim another job.
- Each worker instance owns an isolated `WORKER_ROOT`, lock file, `CODEX_HOME`,
  `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`, Codex auth/config/log/session/cache directories,
  workspace root, artifact root, and worker log.
- Multiple workers on one host must not share Codex config, auth, sqlite state,
  app-server process, sockets, workspaces, artifacts, service user runtime, or
  mutable lifecycle files.
- Worker runtime targets Linux/Ubuntu 22.04 only. Do not add Windows or macOS
  worker runtime behavior.

Codex execution rules:

- Use one instance-scoped Codex App Server per worker; prefer stdio transport or
  a worker-unique Unix socket.
- Do not use `codex exec` for review phases and do not launch one Codex CLI
  process per reviewer/subtask.
- Each run has one root Codex thread. Logical subagents are sequential Codex
  turns by default; the default active Codex turns per worker is one.
- Start the app-server with the worker-owned `CODEX_HOME` and
  `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`, then initialize the JSON-RPC connection before turns.
- Capture Codex events to `codex-events.jsonl` and treat completion/error events
  as authoritative for terminal handling.
- Implement a fixed approval handler even when approval policy is `never`:
  allow writes only under `.codex-review/**`, allow Python standard-library
  helper scripts under `.codex-review/tools/*.py`, allow read-only repository
  inspection commands, and deny source modifications, installs, downloads,
  network access, branch changes, commit, push, and access to other worker
  directories.

Review pipeline rules:

- Full repository scan only; this is not a diff or PR review.
- Do not install third-party dependencies or call external scan/lint/review
  tools such as Semgrep, SonarQube, CodeQL, reviewdog, or MegaLinter.
- Helper scripts must use Python 3 standard library only, write only under
  `.codex-review/runs/**`, and perform mechanical tasks only.
- Codex performs semantic judgment. Helper scripts must not decide whether a
  finding is real, severe, exploitable, or worth fixing.
- Required phases follow `worker-design.md`: prepare workspace, start app
  server, initialize, auth check, bootstrap helper scripts, inventory, token
  budget, repo map, risk routing, bundle planning/packing, reviewer fanout,
  reviewer JSON validation, location validation, clustering/voting, validator
  disproof, final report JSON, markdown render, QA gate, hash artifacts, upload
  artifacts, submit envelope, cleanup active job.
- Required completed artifacts are `report.md`, `report.agent.json`,
  `coverage.json`, `token-budget.json`, `qa.json`, `artifact-manifest.json`,
  `codex-events.jsonl`, and `worker.log.jsonl`.
- Upload artifacts before submitting the terminal result envelope.
- Failed and cancelled jobs must still submit valid terminal envelopes when
  possible, with optional worker log, Codex event log, and error report
  artifacts.

Plan policy:

- Subscription plan policy still controls the model, timeout, repository limits,
  and core reasoning effort.
- Core semantic phases use the plan reasoning effort. Non-core phases use the
  same model with medium reasoning effort.

## Job Slot And Upload Discipline

Each worker instance has exactly one job execution slot. It does not maintain a
local job queue and must claim a new server-side job only after the current job
has finished. The only job slot must not be occupied by avoidable retry sleep or
cleanup IO.

- Final result upload should attempt the immediate request once. Retryable
  network, HTTP 408/429, and 5xx failures should be written to the pending result upload spool and
  retried by the background upload worker.
- Pending result uploads must remain in heartbeat `active_job_ids` so the server
  renews the claimed job lease while the final payload is being retried. They do
  not count as active Codex/job execution capacity.
- Result upload payloads should use gzip compression for large JSON. Keep server
  gzip JSON support and worker compression thresholds aligned.
- Do not add `time.sleep()`-based retry loops to `run_job()` or other code that
  holds the only job execution slot. Put backoff in a background path.
- Pending result upload files live under `.pullwise-result-uploads`; keep this
  directory protected from checkout cleanup.
- Cleanup should run only when the worker is idle or on a low-priority
  background path. Do not run checkout/log cleanup before heartbeat/claim in the
  hot loop.

## Checkout And Cache Discipline

Repository checkout performance depends on the worker mirror cache.

- Keep repository mirrors under `.pullwise-repo-cache` and protect that runtime
  directory from ordinary checkout cleanup.
- Commit-specific jobs should use shallow fetch into the mirror plus a shared
  no-checkout worktree/checkout, not a full fresh clone per job.
- Do not include clone tokens in mirror path names, logs, or persistent config.
  Token-sensitive remote URLs may be used for fetch, but persisted cache
  identity and diagnostics must be redacted.

## Review Evidence Discipline

The v1 worker reports findings through `report.agent.json` and the stable result
envelope. Findings shown to users must be grounded in concrete repository files
and line locations, include a clear failure scenario or risk, and provide an
actionable recommendation. Weak or uncertain observations belong in appendix or
internal artifacts, not as confirmed findings.

Do not require evidence graph generation for worker output. New review logic,
protocols, reports, tests, and documentation must depend on the stable envelope
and versioned artifacts, not on replaced graph-report data structures.

## Server-Controlled Agent Policy

The worker can advertise local provider capability, but review policy comes from
server-provided subscription plan agent configs and per-job `agentConfig`.

- Treat `PULLWISE_PROVIDER_CHAIN` as local installed capability/order, not as the
  source of plan policy.
- `doctor` must load free/pro/max agent configs from the server. If they cannot
  be loaded or validated, do not silently fall back to the local provider chain.
- A claimed job must include `agentConfig` and `repositoryLimits`; reject jobs
  that omit them instead of using local defaults.
- When a job uses Codex in `agentConfig.provider`, require Codex model
  and reasoning effort.
- Repository size limits used by worker preflight come from the job's
  `repositoryLimits`, not from local plan assumptions.

## Readiness Semantics

Provider readiness is plan-aware and provider-specific.

- `provider_ready` means at least one provider required by the loaded plan
  configs is ready.
- `codex_ready` is the Codex login/readiness state required for accepting jobs.
- Only check providers required by the loaded plan configs.
- Login/auth instructions printed by `doctor` must use the same instance-scoped
  command environment documented above.

## Instance-Scoped Files

Do not share mutable runtime files between worker instances.

- `service_home`, `checkout_root`, `log_dir`, provider home/config/cache dirs,
  and service-user commands must stay instance-scoped.
- Cleanup/update/doctor helpers must operate inside the configured worker roots.
- Avoid fixed global paths for checkouts, logs, provider state, or auth files
  unless they are only base directories containing per-worker subdirectories.

## Delete Instance Cleanup

Admin Delete instance must remove the worker-host resources owned by that worker
instance, not merely let the server hide the worker from admin lists. Cleanup
must cover the instance service unit, wrapper, logrotate entry, `/etc` config,
service user when safe, `service_home` under `/var/lib/pullwise-worker`, `log_dir`
under `/var/log/pullwise-worker`, and other instance-scoped runtime files.

Do not assume Pullwise Server is installed on the same host as the worker. The
worker host needs a local lifecycle manager, watcher, supervisor, or finalizer to
own destructive cleanup and status reporting. A worker process can participate
by acknowledging an uninstall command, but durable deletion should not rely only
on the process that is deleting itself; stopped or degraded workers still need a
host-local owner that can remove resources and report failure/success.

A single host may run multiple Pullwise worker instances. Each worker instance
must have its own watcher/supervisor and must not reuse another instance's
worker process, watcher process, systemd unit, service user, env file, config
directory, `service_home`, `log_dir`, runtime directory, uninstall marker, or
provider state. Instance-specific names and paths must be derived from the safe
worker id.
