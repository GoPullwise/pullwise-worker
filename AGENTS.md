# Pullwise Worker Agent Notes

## Worker Host Platform

Pullwise worker installs target Ubuntu 22.04 hosts. Worker runtime, doctor,
update, restart, uninstall, and cleanup changes may assume Linux/systemd
behavior available on Ubuntu 22.04, including `useradd`, `chown`, `chmod`,
`sudo`/`runuser`, logrotate, and systemd unit management. Do not add macOS or
Windows worker installer behavior.

## Worker Provider Isolation

Each worker instance owns its own Codex runtime state. Do not let a
worker use global Codex binaries, global auth, root auth, or another
worker instance's config.

- Provider commands must resolve to absolute paths inside the current worker
  `service_home`, for example:
  - `$service_home/.local/bin/codex`
  - `$service_home/.codex/bin/codex`
- Provider subprocesses must run with instance-scoped environment values:
  - `HOME=$service_home`
  - `USERPROFILE=$service_home`
  - `CODEX_HOME=$service_home/.codex`
  - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$service_home/.config`
  - `XDG_CACHE_HOME=$service_home/.cache`
  - `XDG_DATA_HOME=$service_home/.local/share`
  - `PATH` with this worker's `$service_home/.local/bin`,
    `$service_home/.codex/bin` before the base service path
- Do not inherit global provider credentials such as root `HOME`,
  root `CODEX_HOME`, or global API-key based readiness when checking or running
  provider work.
- `doctor`, provider readiness checks, provider review execution, and semantic
  fallback execution must all use the same instance-scoped provider environment.
- A fresh install followed by no manual action and then `doctor` must report the
  same provider readiness state as the installer reported. In particular,
  `doctor` must not become ready by seeing auth/config from root, a global CLI
  install, or another worker.

Multiple workers on the same server are supported only if each worker uses its
own `service_home` for Codex binaries, config, cache, and auth state.

## Server-Controlled Agent Policy

The worker can advertise local provider capability, but review policy comes from
server-provided subscription plan agent configs and per-job `agentConfig`.

- Treat `PULLWISE_PROVIDER_CHAIN` as local installed capability/order, not as the
  source of plan policy.
- `doctor` must load free/pro/max agent configs from the server. If they cannot
  be loaded or validated, do not silently fall back to the local provider chain.
- A claimed job must include `agentConfig` and `repositoryLimits`; reject jobs
  that omit them instead of using local defaults.
- When a job includes Codex in `agentConfig.providerChain`, require Codex model
  and reasoning effort.
- Repository size limits used by worker preflight come from the job's
  `repositoryLimits`, not from local plan assumptions.

## Readiness Semantics

Provider readiness is plan-aware and provider-specific.

- `provider_ready` means at least one provider required by the loaded plan
  configs is ready.
- `codex_ready` is the Codex login/readiness state required for accepting jobs.
- Only check providers required by the loaded plan configs.
- Login/auth instructions printed by `doctor` must use the same instance-scoped
  command environment documented above.

## Instance-Scoped Files

Do not share mutable runtime files between worker instances.

- `service_home`, `checkout_root`, `log_dir`, provider home/config/cache dirs,
  and service-user commands must stay instance-scoped.
- Cleanup/update/doctor helpers must operate inside the configured worker roots.
- Avoid fixed global paths for checkouts, logs, provider state, or auth files
  unless they are only base directories containing per-worker subdirectories.
